Architecture
************

The overall architecture of Mopidy is organized around multiple frontends and backends.
The frontends use the core API. The core actor makes multiple backends
work as one. The backends connect to various music sources. The core actor use
the mixer actor to control volume, while the backends use the audio actor to
play audio.

    Core -> "Multiple backends"

Further to the above architecture is a "service" interface which may be inherited by any
extension (frontend or backend) in order to support dynamic property configuration and/or
export their API through the http interface thus enabling an end-user to interact with them
through the Mopidy web server.


Frontends
=========

Frontends expose Mopidy to the external world. They can implement servers for
protocols like HTTP, MPD and MPRIS, and they can be used to update other
services when something happens in Mopidy, like the Last.fm scrobbler frontend
does. See :ref:`frontend-api` for more details.

Core
====

The core is organized as a set of controllers with responsiblity for separate
sets of functionality.

The core is the single actor that the frontends send their requests to. For
every request from a frontend it calls out to one or more backends which does
the real work, and when the backends respond, the core actor is responsible for
combining the responses into a single response to the requesting frontend.

The core actor also keeps track of the tracklist, since it doesn't belong to a
specific backend.

See :ref:`core-api` for more details.

    Core -> "Playback\ncontroller"
    Core -> "Playlists\ncontroller"

    Core -> "History\ncontroller"

    "Service\ncontroller" -> "Bluetooth service"
    "Service\ncontroller" -> "Pulse audio service"
    "Service\ncontroller" -> "Extension property setter/getter"

Backends
========

The backends are organized as a set of providers with responsiblity for
separate sets of functionality, similar to the core actor.

Anything specific to i.e. Spotify integration or local storage is contained in
the backends. To integrate with new music sources, you just add a new backend.
See :ref:`backend-api` for more details.

    "Local\nplayback\nprovider" -> Audio

    "Spotify\nplayback\nprovider" -> Audio


Audio
=====

The audio actor is a thin wrapper around the parts of the GStreamer library we
use. In addition to playback, it's responsible for volume control through both
GStreamer's own volume mixers, and mixers we've created ourselves. If you
implement an advanced backend, you may need to implement your own playback
provider using the :ref:`audio-api`.

Services
========

Services allow the functionality of an extension to be exposed through HTTP (via JSON RPC) and
grouped under an assigned unique service name.

Services may also be stopped/restarted under user control, by their service name, after the HTTP
service has started.  Furthermore, services allow internal extension properties to be dynamically
get or set where required thus avoiding the need to edit configuration files on the host.

See :ref:`service-api` for more details.

Mixer
=====

The mixer actor is responsible for volume control and muting. The default
mixer use the audio actor to control volume in software. The alternative
implementations are typically independent of the audio actor, but instead use
some third party Python library or a serial interface to control other forms
of volume controls.
